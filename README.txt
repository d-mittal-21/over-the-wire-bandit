HI, I am Divyansh Mittal currently in my first year under grad from IIT Kanpur. I am from MSE department.
this Repo will be used for my first task given by p club.
The task contains use of commands in linux to decode the password for each level.
.................................
man <command>	//opens a manual for command use
level 1: cat <file name>	//prints the content of the file
level 2: //use ./<file name> in the above command to open files which starts with special characters like -
level 3: //use "<file name>" if there are spaces in the filename
level 4,5,6,7,8: find . -type f -size <> -group <> ! -executable	//find the file with the mentioned properties
level 9,10: string <filename> | grep "<>"	//search the file for the given string
sort <filename> | uniq -c	//sort the data set in file according to the number of occurences.
